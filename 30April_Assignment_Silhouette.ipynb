    "Consider a dataset of fruits that includes apples, oranges, and bananas. A clustering algorithm might produce three clusters that perfectly separate the apples, oranges, and bananas. However, if the algorithm is not able to identify all of the natural groups in the data, then some of the fruits might be misclassified. For example, a few of the apples might be placed in the orange cluster, and a few of the bananas might be placed in the orange cluster.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here is another example of how a clustering result can have high homogeneity but low completeness. Suppose you have a dataset of customers that includes high-value customers, medium-value customers, and low-value customers. A clustering algorithm might produce three clusters that perfectly separate the high-value customers, medium-value customers, and low-value customers. However, if the algorithm is not able to identify all of the natural groups in the data, then some of the customers might be misclassified.
